## JSON staging folder

Drop any large JSON extracts from Google Sheets or Apps Script in this folder before uploading them through the dashboard.

- Keep one file per event (e.g. `igacmun-session-3-2025.json`).
- Follow the format shown in `examples/bulk-import-example.json`.
- Files placed here are **not** imported automatically; they are just a convenient place to store drafts before you upload them inside the dashboard or via the `/api/certificates/bulk-import` endpoint.
